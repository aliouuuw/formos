## Tier 1 — Core ops

Operational basics so agents can work a live campaign without leaving Formos or copying into spreadsheets by hand.

| Backlog ID | What |
|---|---|
| `lead-csv-export` | Filtered CSV/Excel: contact, amount, profile, compte titres, channel, city, UTMs, status, agent, createdAt |
| `lead-list-query` | Server-side status / assignee / intent / amount / channel / source / date / form + search (name/email/phone) + sort + pagination |
| `lead-detail-notes` | Detail drawer/page: submission answers, extras, editable notes, quick contact actions |
| `lead-ipo-fields-ui` | Show `investor_profile` and `securities_account` as badges/columns |
| `lead-work-queue` | “My leads” + unassigned; highlight SLA aging (`new` >24h, `contacted` >72h) |

---

## Tier 2 — Classification & organization

| Backlog ID | What |
|---|---|
| `lead-tags-priority` | Tags (`urgent`, `docs-incomplets`, `VIP`) + optional priority score |
| `lead-duplicates` | Same phone/email → flag or merge, keep history |
| `lead-saved-views` | Presets: Nouveaux WhatsApp, Institutionnels >10M, Sans agent, Fenêtre clôture |
| `lead-bulk-actions` | Multi-select → assign, status, export, tag |
| `lead-kanban` | Optional board by status (list remains primary) |

---

## Tier 3 — Automation & collaboration

| Backlog ID | What |
|---|---|
| `crm-webhooks` | Slack/email (Inngest) on new lead; later HubSpot / Notion / Sheets |
| `lead-click-to-contact` | One-click WhatsApp / call / email from preferred channel + log |
| `lead-round-robin` | Auto-assign across campaign agents |
| `lead-rbac` | Agents see own leads; admins all; optional read-only managers |
| `lead-audit-trail` | Who changed status / assignee / notes, when |

---

## Tier 4 — Advanced / later

| Backlog ID | What |
|---|---|
| `lead-funnel-join` | Source → start → complete → lead → souscrit |
| `partial-submissions` | Abandoned answers → warm recovery queue |
| `lead-smart-routing` | Route by profile / amount / channel |
| `lead-reminders` | Follow-up due dates, overdue badges |
| `lead-reporting-digest` | Daily digest by agent / source / amount |
| `lead-data-quality` | E.164 phones, email DQ, incomplete-dossier flags |
| `gdpr-consent` | Retention + subject export/delete (public consent intentionally omitted on IPO form) |
| Multi-campaign inbox | Unified inbox when campaigns beyond Bridge Bank IPO exist |
| AI assist | Summaries / suggested next step — only after Tier 1–2 are solid |

---

## Suggested process (ops playbook)

Until automation lands, treat `/admin/leads` as the system of record:

1. **Morning** — filter `new` + unassigned; assign agents; clear anything aged >24h.
2. **On contact** — move to `contacted`; note preferred channel and outcome in notes (when notes exist).
3. **Qualification** — use amount + profil + compte titres to prioritize; set `rdv` / `qualified`.
4. **Close** — `souscrit` / `won` / `lost` with a short reason in notes.
5. **Reporting** — until CSV export exists, use insights panels + manual export from submissions if needed.
